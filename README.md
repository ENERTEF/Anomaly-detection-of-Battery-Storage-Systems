# Anomaly detection of Battery Storage Systems

For the 4th valorization case, the backend code is provided, acknowledging that many adaptations will have to be made to each specific battery, system and dataset. However the methodology is provided with an example, which the user will have to update as he finds fit.

Partners share battery operation data to validate the anomaly detection model. A challenge in this type of models is the lack of abnormal observations, which are useful to verify the algorithm and validate the true positive metric of the model. Sharing data allows training and testing of the model and provides the chance to experiment with other technologies.
